# Data Structures & Algorithms – Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms problems.
The problems are primarily solved from **LeetCode** and focus on building strong problem-solving
and algorithmic thinking skills for coding interviews. 

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Recursion
- Backtracking 
- Dynamic Programming
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Traversal, BST, Binary Tree)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Searching & Sorting
- Greedy Algorithms

## Practice Approach
- Problems are solved regularly as part of my daily DSA practice
- Each solution focuses on clarity and correctness
- Emphasis on understanding patterns and approaches rather than memorization

## Platform
- LeetCode

## Purpose
This repository is maintained to:
- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews and placements
- Track consistency and progress in problem solving

## Language Used
- Java

## Notes
- Solutions may include optimized approaches and edge case handling
- The repository will be updated continuously with new problems
